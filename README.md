# Poem Classifier with Markov Model from Scratch

## Overview
This project aims to classify poems using a Markov Model approach. It involves sophisticated text processing techniques and probabilistic modeling to analyze and classify poetic texts.

## Features
- Poem reading and data preparation.
- Text preprocessing including lemmatization and POS tagging.
- Data splitting for training and testing.
- Implementation of a Markov Model for poem classification.

## Technologies
- Python
- Libraries: NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, String

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/poemClassifierWithMarkovModelFromScrach.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install nltk numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` to see the poem classification process in action. The notebook includes detailed steps from data reading to model training and evaluation.
